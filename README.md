This is the **TASK-04** of my internship at Skill Craft Technology.

The task I got is to build a real-time hand gesture recognition model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal of this project is to train a Machine Learning algorithm capable of classifying images of different hand gestures, such as a fist, palm, showing the thumb, and others. With this, I'll be able to gain a deeper understanding of this field and create my own program that fits the data I have.

This project uses the LeapGestRecog dataset

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository because of its size.
